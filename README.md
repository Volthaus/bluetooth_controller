# bluetooth_controller
Using an Arduino, bluetooth module (HC-05 or 06), a 5VDC relay, 110VAC lamp, and Android smart phone or the free software PuTTY you can remotely control an LED or 110 volt device like a lamp for instance. The app used i this project was designed using the MIT App inventor (http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) and I have included the source code for the app which you import into the App inventor to play with the code as you desire.
You are resposible for your own safety if you decide to with with 110 volts of alternating current. Please make sure you know what you're doing so you can work safely.
